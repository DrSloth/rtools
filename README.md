A set of very pedantic Rust tools, mainly thin wrappers around clippy and cargo watch/check.

## Notes
Currently all the clippy flags have to be maintained in various files, this is not that nice but ok.

## Contributing
If you have ideas or proposals open an issue, all sorts of pull requests or additions are welcome.
